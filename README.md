# DE-CardShufflerProject
#Card Shuffler controlled by multiple servos to split and stack the cards in order to mimic the act of shuffling a deck of cards.

Introduction:

The goal of this project was to implement and showcase some of the skills that we learned in the Digital Electronics class. The project uses code, wiring and PWM signals to control servos that are able to move the cards in specific ways. I decided to pursue this project because it was something that is a simple and interesting movement in day to day activities. Furthermore it is something that could be continued and updated to deal the cards out as well.
