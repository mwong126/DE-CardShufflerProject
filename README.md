# DE-CardShufflerProject
#Card Shuffler Main objective: A deivice controlled by a RaspberryPi that powers multiple servos to split and stack a deck of cards in order to mimic the act of shuffling a deck of cards.

Introduction:

The goal of this project was to implement and showcase some of the skills that we learned in the Digital Electronics class. The project uses code, wiring and PWM signals to control servos that are able to move the cards in specific ways. I decided to pursue this project because it was something that is a simple and interesting movement in day to day activities. Furthermore it is something that could be continued and updated to deal the cards out as well.

These two pieces were made using Fusion and act as my main base and the mounts for my wheels that turn the cards.

Manufacturing:

The majority of the parts for this project were 3-d printed due to the ease and speed. It was very simple to simply downnload the file from Fusion as a STL and send it to the printer. Some of the parts took multiple tries to work as they failed or needed to be changed after the fact due to the part not working quite how it was intedended to. The main base was printed first and then the mounts for the wheels. The wheels themselves were Lego which made it very easy to find the exact dimensinos online as well as find existing CAD models of the parts. 

Wiring: 

For the wiring, dupont connecters were used to easily connect the RaspberryPi to the motor drivers and the power supply to the motors.
